# Commands hang and never finish in AdonisJS

After working properly for some time, a weird issue started happening in AdonisJS whenever I would run any command, even
in production.

The command would start, and seemingly do the job, but it would hang and never finish. I would have to kill the process
manually with Ctrl + C.

Turns out the culprit was Redis, I added it right before the issues started happening, because it was opening a
connection and command could not close it and successfully finish.

Since Redis is added as a provider in AdonisJS, and all providers are started when the application starts, the
connection would be opened, but there was no way to close it after the command finishes.

The solution was fairly simple, once I dug into the documentation - I just needed to define the environment in which the
Redis would run in the `adonisrc.ts` file.

This was before:

```typescript
{
  providers: [
    () => import('@adonisjs/core/providers/app_provider'),
    () => import('@adonisjs/core/providers/hash_provider'),
    // other providers
    () => import('#providers/queue_provider'), // <-- this is where a connection to Redis is made // [!code highlight]
  ]
}
```

And to make it work, I had to do it this way:

```typescript
{
  providers: [
    () => import('@adonisjs/core/providers/app_provider'),
    () => import('@adonisjs/core/providers/hash_provider'),
    // other providers here
    { // [!code highlight]
      file: () => import('#providers/queue_provider'), // [!code highlight]
      environment: ['web'] // [!code highlight]
    }, // [!code highlight]
  ]
}
```

You can find a relevant AdonisJS documentation about services
here: [Service Providers](https://docs.adonisjs.com/guides/concepts/service-providers).
