# Nuxt Transition warning

When using the page or layout transitions, Nuxt throws a warning that the component inside the `<Transition>` renders a
non-element root node that cannot be animated.

This happened to me with in Nuxt Content, but it's probably an issue for all Nuxt pages or layouts.

I was using the `pageTransition` and `layoutTransition` options in `nuxt.config.ts` to set the transitions, as explained
in the <a href="https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/transitions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">
Nuxt
documentation</a>.

```typescript
// nuxt.config.ts

export default defineNuxtConfig({
  app: {
    // ... other settings
    pageTransition: {
      name: 'blur',
      mode: 'out-in'
    },
    layoutTransition: {
      name: 'blur',
      mode: 'out-in',
    }
  }
})
```

And in my pages, I had this:

```vue
<template>
  <NuxtLayout name="blog">
    <PostMeta :post-date="postDate" :post-categories="postCategories" />
    <ContentDoc />
    <PostSurround />
  </NuxtLayout>
</template>
```

Although the `<NuxtLayout>` component wraps all the content, when used with transitions, it is necessary to wrap it in a
single element, in order to work correctly.

Therefore, when I changed the code to this:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <NuxtLayout name="blog">
      <PostMeta :post-date="postDate" :post-categories="postCategories" />
      <ContentDoc />
      <PostSurround />
    </NuxtLayout>
  </div>
</template>
```

The warning went away, and the transitions worked as expected.

Later I saw that this is even mentioned in the docs, you can read more about
it <a href="https://nuxt.com/docs/api/components/nuxt-layout#transitions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">
