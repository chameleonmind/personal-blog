Unless you have been living under a rock for the past 20 years, or in some kind of an all-technology-is-evil death cult,
chances are you have probably encountered browsers’ data saving and autofill features. It’s a neat feature for
end-users, lifting the burden of remembering or writing down passwords and authorization data, but sometimes it turns
out to be a nightmare for the developers.

**For the impatient, if you want to see the code right away, jump to the section “The solution”. However, if you want to
read about the journey to it, keep reading.**

You see, as the internet and technology progress, developers also want to give users something functional, notable, and
in most cases, something different. That’s why we design and build different looking websites, forms, and UI’s, that
will create memorable experiences for people, make use of our product a breeze, and our users happy.

For example, in recent years, floating labels in forms became popular, mainly because of libraries such as MaterialUI.
Perhaps you already developed your own, and so you know how it usually goes: you start making it, let's say for login
form, fit all the bits and pieces, then finish it, you may even do a11y right, try to enter login info a few times, and
then on page reload you are treated with a spectacle of something like this:

Well isn’t that lovely? Your labels are in the wrong place, although the data is filled. You suspect that you made some
mistake, but even after a long, hard look, you cannot find it.

You then realize that after clicking anywhere on the page, your inputs seem to wake up, and your labels jump right where
they should be. Interesting…

So, what’s the deal with that? Let me make a little intro first — screenshots above show an example of my custom VueJS
input components. The floating labels are “floated” when input is focused or when there’s a value in the input’s
v-model. Should be straightforward, right? Well, not so much when it comes to Chrome autofill.

At first, I googled, and found pretty much the same answer everywhere, about using the CSS animations to detect browser
autofill (there is a solid article about it [here](https://rojas.io/how-to-detect-chrome-autofill-with-vue-js/)), but
that didn’t actually solve my problem, which was detecting
autofill on page load. CSS animations are not triggered in this case, and as I would find out, some other weird things
are happening too.

So I made a few experiments.

Remember how I said the labels would "wake up" and work as intended after clicking anywhere on the page. Well, my first
hacky approach was to try and click with JS on multiple elements on the page — buttons, inputs, `<html>` itself, but
that
turned out to be a dead-end, it doesn't work that way. My guess is that is how Chrome is supposed to function, it’s
waiting for the actual user interaction on the page and prevents Javascript from accessing the values from inputs until
the user has clicked or touched something on the page. And I was OK with that, seems like a sane thing to do.

In retrospect, I should’ve assumed that the next thing I tried would turn out to be also unsuccessful, but I saw a post
where someone recommended that on StackOverflow, so I said what the hell, let me try this far-fetched thing that a
complete stranger on the internet said it works. It was about polling the input field several times, checking for value
until you found if it has it or not.

So I made another experiment — I created a little function with setInterval that would run on `mounted()` and check my
input fields for value, let it run for some time, and then some more, but it said that values in those fields don’t
exist, it’s empty. I was literally staring into a filled input, but Javascript was unaware of it.

So it hit me that this must be also a part of Chrome’s features — _values of auto-filled inputs on page load are not
accessible through JS until a user interacts with a page_.

But where are those values stored? They must be somewhere, I’m looking at them. That is the question I’m still unable to
answer, so drop me a comment if you have any idea, I’m curious and I would like to know.

I was close to despair, thinking I won't be able to detect this after all, but then I started to closely inspect
everything about these inputs in Dev tools and saw this little section that might be useful, I thought.

How about I check for some of these CSS properties, if they exist, might that mean that the input is auto-filled?

Experiment time again!

To check the CSS properties of an element you cannot just use something
like `document.querySelector("#email-input").appearance`,
it won’t work, as this is not part of the element’s style, but their CSS. What you need to use is
`getComputedStyle`, and it goes something like this:

```javascript
window.getComputedStyle(document.querySelector('#email-input'), null).getPropertyValue('appearance')
```

When I tried that on auto-filled input, it returned `menulist-button` but if I manually filled an input, or tried that
on
an input that was not auto-filled, the result was `auto` . Awesome, that’s something I can use.

## Take one

Armed with this new insight, I made a small function that could check this for me on the input component mount

```js
// detectAutofill.js
// my input component
import { detectAutofill } from '@/utils/detectAutofill'

export function detectAutofill(element) {
  return window.getComputedStyle(element, null).getPropertyValue('appearance') === 'menulist-button'
}

mounted()
{
  this.inputFilled = detectAutofill(this.$refs.input)
}
```

Saved this, opened it in Chrome aaaaand… nothing happened.

What the actual frak? Well, Chrome is not doing this instantly, it waits for the whole page to load, then takes some
time to recognize the inputs and whether it should fill them, and only then it does the auto-filling.

Trouble is, Chrome is not emitting any events when autofill occurs (if it would, we probably wouldn’t have this
problem), so the only solution is to wait some time and then check the inputs.

## The solution

So I changed my function to include the setTimeout function, and turned it into a promise, because why not. I tinkered
with the wait time, tried 150ms, 300ms, but the least timeout I found that always works is 600ms.

Now the function looks like this:

```js
export function detectAutofill(element) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve(window.getComputedStyle(element, null).getPropertyValue('appearance') === 'menulist-button')
    }, 600)
  })
}
```

And then in my input component, I have this method that I would run on the mounted hook:

```js
async
testAutoFill()
{
  this.autofilled = await detectAutofill(this.$refs.input)
}
// ...
mounted()
{
  this.$nextTick(() => {
    this.testAutoFill()
  })
}
```

And it works like a charm.

Tested it on Chrome, Edge, and Firefox. Seems like Chrome and Edge behave the same, which is not surprising, considering
it’s the same engine in both of those, and as for Firefox, I haven’t encountered the same issue, auto-filling seems to
work differently there. I don’t think this will work on IE11, but if you still need to support that… thing, you should
probably check and then not run this function at all there.

Please note that you cannot use this if you set `appearance: none` for inputs in your CSS, which is a common practice
for
some reason. In case that you still want to have this property manually defined in your CSS, try using some of the other
properties found in pseudo-class `:-internal-autofill-selected` .

::message
The described approach was just for the cases when you need to know if the inputs are filled on page load, for other
cases of browser autofill, there are lots of articles written on how to handle it, like the one I mentioned [above](https://rojas.io/how-to-detect-chrome-autofill-with-vue-js/). I’m
using this same approach in my components.
::

I prepared a small project for all of you, so you can see it in action, with a similar use case — not using this check for floating labels, but to enable or disable a Submit button in a form.

The project is written in VueJS, but you can use this approach in any other framework.

You can find it on [Github](https://github.com/chameleonmind/detecting-autofill) and see it live [here](https://detecting-autofill.netlify.app/).
